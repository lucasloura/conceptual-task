# Conceptual Task

  Conceptual task is a small project developed by me as a college assignment during February of 2022. The proposal of the assignment was to make a menu providing navigation for the user through the use of shortcuts to some programs and computer tools using only Batch.

  Had a lot of fun doing this, and even though it's just text, I think the UI came out pretty solid.
